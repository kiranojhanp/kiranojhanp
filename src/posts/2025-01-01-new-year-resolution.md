# A Fresh Start: Navigating Life, Work, and Growth in Australia

They say the biggest changes in life often start with the smallest decisions. For me, it was a moment of clarity in the midst of a successful tech career – a realization that sometimes you need to take a step back to leap forward. As I write this in January 2025 from my home in Perth, I'm reflecting on the whirlwind year that turned me from a burnt-out software developer in Nepal to someone who's rediscovered their spark through the most unexpected journey.

## The Reality of Success

In January 2024, I had what many would consider a perfect life. A well-paying job at a prestigious international software agency, a loving relationship with my now-wife, a new pet, and the world's best parents. On paper, everything was perfect. But beneath the surface, I was grappling with burnout from the constant grind and a deep-seated feeling of not being enough. I've never been someone who could pretend everything was fine when it wasn't – sometimes I envy those who can.

## Family and Sacrifice

My story wouldn't be complete without mentioning my parents' incredible sacrifice. My mother had just returned from 13 years of foreign employment – a common reality in Nepal, where overseas work is often necessary due to limited local opportunities. My father raised us largely on his own, working almost 13-hour everyday yet never failing to take care of us. They spent most of their married life apart to ensure we had a good home, quality education, and a stable life. They never took shortcuts or compromised their integrity, proving that honest hard work still pays off, even in a world that sometimes suggests otherwise.

## Success and its Price: A Hard Lesson

Success in a developing country like Nepal is often measured primarily in financial terms, and I was no exception. Fortunately, the IT industry boom coincided perfectly with my career, leading to exponential growth in a few short years. At first, the financial freedom was exhilarating – a new experience for someone like me. But eventually, it became just numbers in a bank account.

My love for computers and learning became a double-edged sword. After eight hours of work, I'd spend countless more hours on Reddit, Hacker News, dev.to, and Tech Twitter. Weekends were devoted to trying out new technologies to show off on Monday. Looking back, it was clearly unsustainable, but the dopamine hits were addictive. Fortunately, I recognized the signs before reaching complete burnout, unlike some colleagues who left the field entirely.

## A New Beginning in Australia

After much consideration, we chose Australia for our fresh start, specifically Perth. As an introvert, Australia's culture appealed to me, and Perth's laid-back atmosphere and spacious environment felt perfect. The transition wasn't always smooth – there were moments of doubt, especially when my father faced a serious medical condition shortly after we arrived. That was when the distance from home felt most acute.

## Growth in the Struggle

My 2024 goal was to push beyond my comfort zone, and I embraced it fully. I worked as a salesman, gas station attendant, food delivery driver, and cleaner. These experiences taught me more about myself than years in tech had. Back home, life had felt dormant, but here, despite the physical demands and daily challenges, I feel more alive than ever. Yes, we have debts, and yes, the work is demanding, but we're proud of our journey. Australia isn't cheap, but the growth opportunities make it worthwhile.

## Looking Forward

The past year has been transformative. We've progressed from a tiny room in a shared flat, walking 15,000 steps daily, to having our own place and car. I've completed my first year of masters with strong grades. As 2025 begins, I'm ready to return to IT with a fresh perspective. I'm working on open-source projects I've always dreamed of creating and diving into AI and Data Science from scratch. The goal is clear: return to software development, contribute meaningfully to open source, and explore the frontiers of AI.

## The Road Ahead

Looking back at my journey from Nepal to Australia, I remember something my father once told me: "उपलब्धिहरू प्रायः चुनौतीको रूपमा प्रकट हुन्छन्।" (Translation: "Life’s greatest achievements often come disguised as its biggest challenges.") A year ago, I was an engineer who felt stuck; today, I’m a student and working part-time, and surprisingly, the happiest I’ve been in years. This experience has shown me that success isn’t just about climbing higher – sometimes it’s about taking a different path.

The culture here in Australia is quite different, and at first, it was a shock. Not necessarily bad, but definitely something I wasn't used to. Honestly, I still haven’t fully adapted. Most of my friends are from Nepal, and I don’t have many Australian friends. This year, I want to change that. I’m focused on learning more about Australian culture and hoping to connect with a few local friends.

Adjusting to a new environment hasn’t been without its challenges. Like many, I’ve encountered moments that made me feel like an outsider. While not everyone shares these views, at times, the differences in cultures can feel more pronounced. Still, I remain hopeful that things will improve. For now, I’ll keep pushing forward, learning, and trying to bridge the gaps.
