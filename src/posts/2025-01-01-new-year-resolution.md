# A New Chapter: My Journey from Nepal to Australia

They say the biggest changes in life often start with the smallest decisions. For me, it was a moment of clarity in the midst of a successful tech career – a realization that sometimes you need to take a step back to leap forward. As I write this in January 2025 from my home in Perth, I'm reflecting on the whirlwind year that transformed me from a burnt-out software developer in Nepal to someone who's rediscovered their spark through the most unexpected journey.

## Life on Paper vs. Reality

In January 2024, I had what many would consider a perfect life. A well-paying job at a prestigious international software agency, a loving relationship with my now-wife, a new pet, and the world's best parents. On paper, everything was perfect. But beneath the surface, I was grappling with burnout from the constant grind and a deep-seated feeling of not being enough. I've never been someone who could pretend everything was fine when it wasn't – sometimes I envy those who can.

## The Foundation That Shaped Me

My story wouldn't be complete without mentioning my parents' incredible sacrifice. My mother had just returned from 13 years of foreign employment – a common reality in Nepal, where overseas work is often necessary due to limited local opportunities. My father raised us largely on his own, working grueling 13-hour days yet never failing to take care of us. They spent most of their married life apart to ensure we had a good home, quality education, and a stable life. They never took shortcuts or compromised their integrity, proving that honest hard work still pays off, even in a world that sometimes suggests otherwise.

## The Success Paradox

Success in the developing world is often measured primarily in financial terms, and I was no exception. The IT industry boom coincided perfectly with my career, leading to exponential growth in a few short years. At first, the financial freedom was exhilarating – a new experience for someone like me. But eventually, it became just numbers in a bank account.

My love for computers and learning became a double-edged sword. After eight hours of work, I'd spend countless more hours on Reddit, Hacker News, dev.to, and Tech Twitter. Weekends were devoted to trying out new technologies to show off on Monday. Looking back, it was clearly unsustainable, but the dopamine hits were addictive. Fortunately, I recognized the signs before reaching complete burnout, unlike some colleagues who left the field entirely.

## The Australian Chapter

After much consideration, we chose Australia for our fresh start, specifically Perth. As an introvert, Australia's culture appealed to me, and Perth's laid-back atmosphere and spacious environment felt perfect. The transition wasn't always smooth – there were moments of doubt, especially when my father faced a serious medical condition shortly after we arrived. That was when the distance from home felt most acute.

## Growth Through Discomfort

My 2024 goal was to push beyond my comfort zone, and I embraced it fully. I worked as a salesman, gas station attendant, food delivery driver, and cleaner. These experiences taught me more about myself than years in tech had. Back home, life had felt stagnant, but here, despite the physical demands and daily challenges, I feel more alive than ever. Yes, we have debts, and yes, the work is demanding, but we're proud of our journey. Australia isn't cheap, but the growth opportunities make it worthwhile.

## Looking Forward

The past year has been transformative. We've progressed from a tiny room in a shared flat, walking 15,000 steps daily, to having our own place and car. I've completed my first year of masters with strong grades. As 2025 begins, I'm ready to return to IT with a fresh perspective. I'm working on open-source projects I've always dreamed of creating and diving into AI and Data Science from scratch. The goal is clear: return to software development, contribute meaningfully to open source, and explore the frontiers of AI.

## The Road Ahead

Looking back at my journey from Nepal to Australia, I'm reminded of something my father once said: "Life's greatest achievements often come disguised as its biggest challenges." A year ago, I was a successful developer who felt stuck; today, I'm a student, a part-time worker, and surprisingly, the happiest I've been in years. This transition taught me that success isn't just about climbing higher – sometimes it's about having the courage to climb a different mountain altogether.

As I step into 2025, I carry with me not just dreams of returning to tech, but the invaluable lessons learned from every uncomfortable moment, every challenge faced, and every small victory celebrated. My story isn't about giving up a comfortable life; it's about having the courage to restart one. And as I look toward the future, I realize that the greatest code I'll ever write isn't in any programming language – it's in the way we choose to rewrite our own story, one brave decision at a time.
